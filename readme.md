This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for active fault observations. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

This spreadsheet indicates the content requested for features representing active fault traces.  Design is focused on faults portrayed as line segments.  The content model is based on the GeoSciML thematic view for ShearDisplacementStructure (see https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/bin/view/CGIModel/GeoSciMLThematicViewModel), extended with some convienence properties specific to young fault structures. Active in this context denotes that there is compelling evidence of fault displacement during the Quaternary.

Services are currently deployed using the tagged 1.2 version.
